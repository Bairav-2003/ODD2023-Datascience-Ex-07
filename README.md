# Ex-07-Feature-Selection
## AIM
To Perform the various feature selection techniques on a dataset and save the data to a file. 

# Explanation
Feature selection is to find the best set of features that allows one to build useful models.
Selecting the best features helps the model to perform well. 

# ALGORITHM
### STEP 1
Read the given Data
### STEP 2
Clean the Data Set using Data Cleaning Process
### STEP 3
Apply Feature selection techniques to all the features of the data set
### STEP 4
Save the data to the file
